# CSS Complete Guide: Revamped
The repository improves the now abandoned and frustrating to use [CSS - The Complete Guide (incl. Flexbox, Grid and Sass)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CSS---The-Complete-Guide-incl.-Flexbox-Grid-and-Sass-) repository. It contains a restructed version of all the supporting project files required for the course.

## About the Video Course
Every web developer has to know CSS. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a "programming language" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into a really beautiful website. This course covers it all. We start at the very basics and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. We do this by showing you both practical examples and the theory behind them. 
Getting started with CSS might look easy, but there actually is a lot of depth to CSS, so this course provides different "Tracks" or "Entry points" to exactly meet your demands and reflect your current knowledge level: 

* **The Basics Track** Start from scratch and learn CSS from the ground up. You start with lecture one and simply follow through to the end.
* **The Advanced Track** You already know the CSS basics, you know what selectors are and how it works, but you want to dive in deeper and learn some advanced features and usages.
* **The Expert Track** You got the advanced knowledge, too, but you want to dive into things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, or Sass. This track is for you.

In the course project, we'll build the front end (no back end) of a fictional web hosting company. We'll have a starting screen with different sections: a responsive design with an animated side-drawer, modals and forms, and lot of CSS animations, font styles, and more!
  
**NOTE:** *The assignment problem and solution videos along with the corresponding codes are presented in the respective section folders on this GitHub repo.*
